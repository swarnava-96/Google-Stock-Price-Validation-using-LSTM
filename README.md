# Google-Stock-Price-Validation-using-LSTM
In this project I have checked how LSTMs work on predicting stock prices. I have taken the "GOOG" stock prices for the entire year of 2016 as my training data and predicted the stock prices for the month of January, 2017. The test data contains the actual stock prices for January 2017. The goal is to verify how well LSTM performs as I already know the actual stock prices for January, 2017. The dataset was collected from Yahoo Finance. Here, I have considered the feature "Open" and based on that, I have predicted and validated the model.
